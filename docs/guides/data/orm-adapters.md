title: ORM Adapters
---

Denali takes a somewhat unique approach to handling the data layer. Unlike
most frameworks, it doesn't come bundled with a "blessed" ORM or attempt to
build it's own. Instead, Denali's Model class works with your ORM of choice
by communicating with it through an ORM Adapter.

This lets you bring your own ORM to your apps, while still enabling Denali to
understand your data model. This is good news for your app since it lets you
pick the right ORM for the job and leverage the strengths of the specific
data store backing your app, rather than relying on a
lowest-common-denominator data layer.

Normally, you won't need to write your own ORM adapters, you can just use any
of the community supported ones. However, you may need to familiarize
yourself with any additional, custom query APIs, data types, etc that the
adapter may support.

## Available ORM Adapters

Several popular ORMs have Denali adapters ready to go. Just add them to your
project via `$ denali install <adapter package name>`, and set the `ormAdapter`
property in your `config/environment.js` file to the ORM's name.

* [`node-orm2`](https://github.com/denali-js/denali-node-orm2) (beta)
* [`objection`](https://github.com/denali-js/denali-objection) (beta)
* ~~`Sequelize`~~ (coming soon)
* ~~`Bookshelf`~~ (coming soon)

## Creating an ORM Adapter

Want to use an ORM that doesn't have an adapter yet? It's fairly easy to
write your own! Just extend from [the base `ORMAdapter`
class](https://github.com/denali-js/denali/blob/master/lib/data/orm-adapter.ts),
and implement each of the hooks defined in the base class.

When you are ready to test out your adapter, you can use a prebuilt test suite to ensure your adapter is ready for primetime: [@denali-js/adapter-test-suite](FIXME).
