 * Denali can build on top of that.

   * Find a record by ID, basic query, or adapter-specific query.
   *
   * To find a single record by it's id, just call:
   *
   *     Post.find(1)
   *
   * Denali also allows users to supply simple queries in a universal format
   * of an object with properties:
   *
   *     Post.find({ title: 'foo' })
   *
   * This allows basic querying regardless of the ORM used. However, for more
   * advanced use cases, rather than trying to design a single interface that
   * could support all ORMs, Denali simply defers to ORM specific syntax via
   * a query function:
   *
   *     Post.find((myQueryBuilder) => {
   *       return myQueryBuilder.foo('bar');
   *     });
   *
   * This approach allows you to provide ultimately flexibility for querying
   * (the arguments to the query function are supplied by you and can be ORM
   * specific).
   *
   * The `options` argument allows for additional, orthogonal options in case
   * your ORM needs it. It's treated as an opaque, pass through value by Deanli.

   * resolve to empty arrays (not rejections), or `null` if a single record was
