/**
 * ES6 classes don't provide any native syntax or support for compositional
 * mixins. This helper method provides that support:
 *
 *     import { mixin } from '@denali-js/core';
 *     import MyMixin from '../mixins/my-mixin';
 *     import ApplicationAction from './application';
 *
 *     export default class MyAction extends mixin(ApplicationAction, MyMixin) {
 *       // ...
 *     }
 *
 * Objects that extend from Denali's Object class automatically get a static
 * `mixin` method to make the syntax a bit more familiar:
 *
 *     export default class MyAction extends ApplicationAction.mixin(MyMixin) {
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * Since ES6 classes are based on prototype chains, and protoype chains are
 * purely linear (you can't have two prototypes of a single object), we
 * implement mixins by creating anonymous intermediate subclasses for each
 * applied mixin.
 *
 * Mixins are defined as factory functions that take a base class and extend it
 * with their own mixin properties/methods. When these mixin factory functions
 * are applied, they are called in order, with the result of the last mixin
 * feeding into the base class of the next mixin factory.
 *
 * ## Use sparingly!
 *
 * Mixins can be useful in certain circumstances, but use them sparingly. They
 * add indirection that can be surprising or confusing to later developers who
 * encounter the code. Wherever possible, try to find alternatives that make
 * the various dependencies of your code clear.

 * This is useful to allow per-use options for your mixin. For example:
 *
 *     class ProtectedAction extends Action.mixin(authenticate({ ... })) {
 *
 * In that example, the optons object provided to the `authenticate` mixin
 * function will be cached, and once the mixin factory function is invoked, it
